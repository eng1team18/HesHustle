Hello friends

Use this repo to download the current project(pull) make whatever chnages you need to then update the repo with your new code (push)

We can talk more about how to use github at the meetings but for now look into it yourself a little, It's a very employable skill to have and I've been told an invaluable tool to have in industry

I'll update this read me with more info you guys need to know then at the end we'll wipe this read me and make it an info hub for the user.

All the best, Michael
